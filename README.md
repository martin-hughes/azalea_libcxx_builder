# Azalea Libc++ Builder tool

Given the location of the source code for LLVM's Libc++ this tool builds a C++ Library that can be used in a system
running Project Azalea.

The simplest way to get started is using the [Azalea Builder](https://github.com/martin-hughes/azalea_builder), but if
you prefer you can also execute `builder.py` in the root of this tree. You will be prompted for the necessary
parameters by the script. They are then remembered for future builds.
